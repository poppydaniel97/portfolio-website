          <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
          <p>
            In the midst of a global pandemic, with no galleries open, upcoming artists and creatives are struggling more than every to begin their career and promote their artwork. Ultimately, there is a need for them to have a platform they can
            control which showcases their work remotely.

          <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
          <p>
            Virtual Exhibitions is an app aimed for artists who want to share their creativity. Artists are able to market their own artwork and curate their own exhibitions. Users are able to directly contact the artists about phrasing
            artwork/showcasing for future exhibitions. Further, they can also support the artists by sharing their talent on other social media platforms.

          <h2>TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
          <p>
            From the offset, I wanted to create a clear and sophisticated app. I therefore decided to use a reduced colour palette and modern typography. Ultimately, I wanted users to open the app and feel as though they were standing in a modern art
            gallery. Furthermore, I didn’t want any style choices to distract the viewers away from the artwork on the app. With that in mind, I stuck to monochromatic colour palette, implementing the iOS system colours on the iOS screens where
            necessary.
          </p>

          <p>
            In terms of typography, for the Android screens I used ‘Roboto’ and for the iOS screens I used ‘San francisco Display’. For the headings however, I used ‘Italiana’ for both iOS and Android.
